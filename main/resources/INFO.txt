- Vanilla

- PseudoRP
    Description: Comparable to using a cellphone. Nearby players can't see who you're talking to, but they

                 defined in "Config.yml".

                 the range you've defined. (Similar to a Crystal Ball)
    Also will disable any for of /PM that isn't handled through the item itself.


- Off
    Description: Just turns off the ability to private message other players. Usually recommended for serious Roleplay servers.
    PM's will be forced "Off" if "Orb Of Communications" is enabled.
